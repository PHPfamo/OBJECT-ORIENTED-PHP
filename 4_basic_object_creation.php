	This is a fun part ;) now remeber everything is an object, 
	as we are thinking object oriented way we need to access things inside our class,
	best way to do it is by creating our first object wit a new key word.
	One class can have more then one object, so this is a good time to think of our class
	as a blueprint for large scale copy/paste operation, but without copying pasting all the time.
	This is a thing we call instance (creating object out of a class).
